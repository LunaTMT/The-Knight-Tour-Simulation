## Warnsdorff's algorithm&#x20;

Warnsdorff's algorithm is a heuristic approach used to solve the knight's tour problem on a chessboard. The problem is to find a sequence of moves by a knight on an $$�×�n×n$$ chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

Overview on Warnsdorff's&#x20;

#### Steps of the Algorithm:

1. **Initialize the Board:**
   * Begin with an empty $$�×�n×n$$ chessboard.
   * Choose a starting square for the knight.
2. **Choose Next Move:**
   * From the current position of the knight, find all legal moves that haven't been visited yet.
3. **Heuristic:**
   * Among the legal moves, choose the one that leads to a square with the fewest subsequent legal moves.
   * This is the core of Warnsdorff's algorithm—prioritize moves that have the fewest available next moves. The intention is to decrease the chances of hitting a dead end too soon.
4. **Repeat:**
   * Move the knight to the chosen square.
   * Mark the square as visited.
   * Repeat steps 2 to 3 until all squares have been visited exactly once or until it's impossible to make a valid move.
5. **Backtracking:**
   * If the knight reaches a position where no more moves are possible, backtrack to the previous square and try the next best move.

#### Key Points:

* **Heuristic Approach:** Warnsdorff's algorithm is a heuristic, meaning it's not guaranteed to find a solution but aims for efficient decision-making.
* **Optimization:** By choosing the square with the fewest available next moves, Warnsdorff's algorithm tries to avoid early dead ends and improves the chances of finding a solution.
* **Backtracking:** If the algorithm reaches a point where it cannot continue (no available moves from a square), it backtracks to the previous square and explores a different path.
* **Efficiency:** While it doesn't guarantee a solution for all board sizes or starting positions, it tends to perform well on many $$�×�n×n$$ chessboards, finding solutions relatively quickly.

Overall, Warnsdorff's algorithm is a popular and straightforward heuristic approach for solving the knight's tour problem, providing a good balance between efficiency and simplicity.
